Programming a chess game in python

This is my first attempt at creating a chess game in python. I am using pygame to display graphics for the game. At the moment, I am most focused on creating a working engine for the game which means being able to generate valid moves, checking when the game is over, and evaluating chess positions somewhat efficiently. Afterwards, I will focus on implementing features to add more customization such as how difficult do you want the computer to be or what do you want the color of the board to be? My end goal is to create an engine that is capable of beating decent players on sites like chess.com and by decent I mean around 90th percentile. Obviously, it would be cheating to use an engine so I can simply request people to play unrated games against me.
